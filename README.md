Currently exploring backend and devops stuff.

Projects I'm currently working on:
1. <a href="github.com/MridulDhiman/code-shard">CodeShard</a>: browser based collaborative code editor with built-in frontend templates support, in next.js.
2. <a href="github.com/MridulDhiman/remote-code-execution-engine">Remote Code Execution Engine</a>: multithreaded code execution API written in golang.
